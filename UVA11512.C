 * GATTACA: (Strings)
 *
 * Input
 *
 * The first line of the input contains an integer T specifying the number of
 * test cases ( 1 $ \leq$ T $ \leq$ 100 ). Each test case consists of a single
 * line of text that represents a DNA sequence S of length n
 * ( 1 $ \leq$ n $ \leq$ 1000 ).
 * You can suppose that each sequence S only contains the letters
 * A, C, G and T.
 *
 * Output
 *
 * For each sequence in the input, print a single line specifying the largest
 * substring of S that appears two or more times repeated in S , followed by a
 * space, and the number of ocurrences of the substring in S .
 * If there are two or more substrings of maximal length that are repeated,
 * you must choose the least according to the lexicographic order.
 * If there is no repetition in S , print ``No repetitions found!''
